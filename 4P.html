            <p class="sub-text">
                We believe that in order to successfully market our product, we need to understand the fundamental strategies such as understanding our audience, conducting good market research and the promotion of our products online through social media platforms such as Instagram and any other viable platform that fit Custom Junction.

            <p class="sub-text">
                We will be conducting Cost-Based Pricing on our products and services. Through cost-based pricing we determine our own perceived list price by adding up a marking percentage to a product's cost. The advantages that come with this is that it is very easy to control the price of a good product or service through this method.

            <p class="sub-text">
                The place of distribution will be conducted online and as Custom Junction has no designated physical location that is accessible at this current moment in time. Through a web based system created with HTML, CSS & Javascript along with a JS Framework, Custom Junction's products and services will be sold and available for browsing on the Custom Junction Website.

                PROMOTION -
            </h1>

            <p class="sub-text">
                We wish to make people aware of Custom Junction in the hope that it persuades them to buy it through computer programs, public relations, and social media. These are some of the driving factors that will help promote our products as a result of our recent feasibility study and liability newness. The computer program AdSense, will be used to gain income, monetize our website and allow users to get recommended ads based on their search history and interest in return. The use of public relations boosts efforts in promoting Custom Junction via media outlets, journalists, newspapers and blog sites in our industry.
